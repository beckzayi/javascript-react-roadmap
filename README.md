# JavaScript and React Roadmap

As there are so many web technologies that developers need to learn, we here try to provide a summary of main technologies, which include JavaScript, React, Redux, ES6, Node etc. It is important to write down some common and useful techniques, so that we avoid repeatedly googling the solution in every project.
